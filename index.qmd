## Social Science Use Cases

This tutorial addresses the technical challenge in social science research of assessing the impact of academic mobility, a topic of growing importance in the context of globalization and international collaboration in academia.


## Step-by-step Guide

In this tutorial, we illustrate how propensity score matching using [this method](https://github.com/momenifi/methodHub/blob/main/academic_mobility_propensity_score/method/) can be used to estimate the effect of a treatment or intervention by accounting for the co-variates that predict the receiving treatment. 
It includes step-by-step instructions, example code, and explanations to facilitate understanding and implementation.

In this example, the propensity score method is employed to estimate the causal effect of academic mobility on researchers' outcomes in terms of: 
- Research productivity
- Received citations 
- Collaboration indicators
  
Academic mobility, represented by the treatment variable *"MOBILE"*, distinguishes between researchers who have experienced academic mobility to other countries *(MOBILE = 1)* as the treatment group and those who have not *(MOBILE = 0)* as a control group. The method aims to balance covariates such as *region, main field of study, international co-authorship, gender, age, and origin country GDP per capita* of the researchers between mobile and non-mobile researchers. By balancing covariates through 'propensity score matching', the method allows for a more accurate assessment of the impact of academic mobility on outcomes mentioned above via indicators:
- CPP (citations per paper)
- PPY (number of papers per year)
- COPP (co-authors per paper).

*Standardized Mean Difference (SMD)* assesses the covariance balance between treatment and control groups before and after matching.  *SMD* is commonly used in *propensity score matching*, with a lower SMD indicating better balance and greater comparability regarding covariates. SMD facilitates comparing effect sizes across different studies or analyses, especially when outcome variables have different scales. In the context of this method, SMD is calculated for both unmatched and matched data to evaluate the balance achieved after matching. The treatment group consists of researchers who have experienced academic mobility to other countries (MOBILE = 1), while the control group consists of researchers who have not experienced academic mobility (MOBILE = 0).

The *Mean Difference* for each variable of interest (CPP, PPY, COPP) quantifies the average difference in these research productivity, received citations, and collaboration indicators between mobile and non-mobile researchers. A positive Mean Difference indicates that mobile researchers, on average, have higher values of the respective metric than non-mobile researchers and vice versa. For example, 
- A *positive Mean Difference* in CPP suggests that mobile researchers receive more citations per paper than non-mobile researchers.
- A *negative Mean Difference* indicates that mobile researchers, on average, have lower values of the respective metric than non-mobile researchers.
Understanding the sign and magnitude of *Mean Differences* provides insights into the direction and magnitude of the impact of academic mobility on research productivity, received citations, and collaboration indicators.


To utilize the propensity score matching technique for assessing the impact of academic mobility on research productivity, received citations, and collaboration indicators, follow these steps:

1. Download Files:
   
Download the following files into a single folder:

- ["mydata_sample.csv"](https://github.com/momenifi/methodHub/blob/main/academic_mobility_propensity_score/tutorial/mydata_sample.csv): Input dataset containing the relevant variables for analysis.
- ["propensity_matching_functions.R"](https://github.com/momenifi/methodHub/blob/main/academic_mobility_propensity_score/tutorial/propensity_matching_functions.R): R script containing functions for propensity score matching.
- ["main_script.R"](https://github.com/momenifi/methodHub/blob/main/academic_mobility_propensity_score/tutorial/main_script.R): R script for executing the analysis.

2. Run Commands in "main_script.R":

- Open "main_script.R" in your R environment.
- Run the commands sequentially to execute the analysis.

3. Load Input Dataset:

Execute the following lines to load the input dataset into R as `data_sample.`:

      # Get the directory path of the main_script.R
      ```{r}
      script_dir <- dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path)
      ```

      # Example usage:
      ```{r}
      data_sample <- read.table(file.path(script_dir, "mydata_sample.csv"), header = TRUE, sep = ",", quote = "\r", dec = ".")
      ```
       
**Sample Input Data:** Sample input data can be provided in CSV format with columns representing variables of interest (PPY, COPP, CPP), a treatment indicator (MOBILE), and covariates (REGION, MAIN_FIELD, INTERNATIONAL_COAUTHOR, GENDER, GDP_PC_ORIGIN, AGE). (mydata_sample.csv).
Here is a screenshot of sample input data:

4. Define Functions:

Execute this line to define the necessary functions from "propensity_matching_functions.R":

    ```{r}
    source(file.path(script_dir, "propensity_matching_functions.R"))
    ```

5. Define Treatment Variable and Covariates:

Define the treatment variable (`treatment_var`) as "MOBILE" and covariates (`covariates`) as "REGION", "MAIN_FIELD", "INTERNATIONAL_COAUTHOR", "GENDER", "GDP_PC_ORIGIN", and "AGE":

    # Define variables
    ```{r}
    treatment_var <- "MOBILE"  # Specify your treatment variable
    covariates <- c("REGION", "MAIN_FIELD", "INTERNATIONAL_COAUTHOR", "GENDER", "GDP_PC_ORIGIN", "AGE")
    ```

6. Perform Propensity Score Matching:

Call the `perform_propensity_matching` function with parameters `data_sample`, `treatment_var`, and `covariates` to conduct propensity score matching:

    # Perform propensity score matching
    ```{r}
    matching_results <- perform_propensity_matching(data = data_sample, treatment_var = treatment_var, covariates = covariates)
    ```

The output includes standardized mean differences (SMDs) of unmatched/matched data (`unmatched_smd` and `matched_smd`):

    # Access SMDs of unmatched and matched data
    ```{r}
    unmatched_smd <- matching_results$unmatched_smd
    matched_smd <- matching_results$matched_smd
    ```
      
    and the matched data:
      
    # Matched data
    ```{r}
    matched_data <- matching_results$matched_data
    ```

7. Define Variables of Interest:

Define the variables of interest (`vars_of_interest`) as "PPY", "CPP", and "COPP":

    ```{r}
    vars_of_interest <- c("PPY", "CPP", "COPP")  # Specify variables for mean difference calculation
    ```
     

8. Calculate Mean Differences:

Call the `calculate_mean_diff` function in line 33 of "main_script.R" with parameters `matched_data`, `treatment_var`, and `vars_of_interest` to calculate mean differences for the variables of interest.

    # Calculate mean differences
    ```{r}
    mean_diff <- calculate_mean_diff(data = matched_data, treatment_var = treatment_var, vars_of_interest = vars_of_interest)
    ```
   
    The output provides the mean differences of `vars_of_interest`.

   # Print mean differences 
    ```R
    print(mean_diff)
    ```
     
**Sample Output:** Sample output includes standardized mean differences (SMD) for unmatched and matched data, as well as mean differences, t-values, and standard errors for variables of interest. 
      
**Standard Mean Deviation:** By examining the SMD for unmatched and matched data under different covariances, we assess the effectiveness of the matching process in achieving balance between the treatment and control groups. A lower SMD indicates a smaller       difference between the two groups. For instance, in this example, the SMD for the variable "AGE" is 0.34 for unmatched data and 0.03 for matched data. This suggests that the treatment group in the matched data is more similar to the control group compared to the unmatched data.

**Mean difference:** Example for the interpretation: A mean difference of 3.04 for the variable CPP indicates that, on average, the treatment group's CPP value is 3.04 units higher than that of the control group.

By following these steps, you can successfully conduct propensity score matching analysis to assess the impact of academic mobility on research productivity and collaboration indicators, focusing on the variables of interest "PPY", "CPP", and "COPP".
